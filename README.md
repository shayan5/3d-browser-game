# Track-Racer
This project features a 3D browser based racing game and track editor. It was built using JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js and <a href="https://threejs.org/">Three.js</a> which is a JavaScript library for creating and animating 3D graphics via WebGL.

The player controls a racer using the w, a, s, d keys around a race track while aiming for speed boost tiles and avoiding grassy tiles in order to finish in the lowest amount of time.

The inspiration for this came from the existing Three.js racing project <a href="https://github.com/thatshaman/CharrioKart">CharrioKart</a> which provided a fixed number of race tracks. I wanted to provide players the ability to create their own tracks and be able to instantly play them which lead to development of an integrated level editor.

All icons and sprites were retrieved from https://opengameart.org/.
